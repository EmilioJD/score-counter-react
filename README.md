First attempt at making a React/NodeJS app. Was initially for an interview. Quite measly but code nonetheless.

**Project**

 This project was made using NodeJS and ReactJS and is a simple counter that
 can keep tally of a tennis game. Click player 1 scored to increase their
 score, click player 2 scored to increase their score.

** Use **

Run "npm start" in score-counter directory
Access the local version from "http://localhost:3000/"
