# Project
 This project was made using NodeJS and ReactJS and is a simple counter that
 can keep tally of a tennis game. Click player 1 scored to increase their
 score, click player 2 scored to increase their score.

#Use
The way to use this app is to navigate to the "score-counter-react" directory
and run the command "npm start" which will start a server on the 3000 local port.
Therefore the website can be accessed from "http://localhost:3000/" or whatever
your local port is. Additionally, a video of use can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Vsz9oEy68g&ab_channel=EmilioDeLeon
